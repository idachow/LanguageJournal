It is a simple language learning application focused on 
chronological learning and reviewing in a more colloquial 
and spontaneous language environment. 

In context, it works as a supplement in cases like teaching
English to ESL learners, as a catalogue of what they are currently learning.

On the main menu there are two buttons:
1) View all (noted by three lines)
2) Add vocab (noted by a plus sign)

1) You can view all vocab you have added, as well as edit any
	individual part of the vocab (such as the definition, or the audio), and re-record audio you don't like after replaying it. You also can remove vocab you have familiarized and no longer need to learn.
2) You can add vocab, with or without audio (for pronunciation),
	and you can audio at a later point by editing it in the view 
	all window.
